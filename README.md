# Movie Genre Classification

Predicting movie genres based on their descriptions using machine learning.

## Overview

Movie Genre Prediction is a project that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to predict the genre of a movie based on its description. The project utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset of movie descriptions and genres.

## Features

- Text preprocessing using lowercase conversion, removing special characters, and stemming.
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for genre prediction.

## Getting Started
